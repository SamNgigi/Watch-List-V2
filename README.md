To read the error carefully first to understand it. Try to figure it

out, google then try a couple of solutions before asking for help

## ModuleNotFoundError

First check if you are in your virtual environment.

Then check if you have installed the module.

If you have made sure that you have installed the module properly and you are still getting this error, try uninstalling the module then re-installing it again.

If the problem persists you may have to remove the virtual folder. Make sure you are on the root directory.

1. Deactivate your virtual environment

2. rm -rf virtual environment

3. Create you virtual environment again.

4. Reinstall the dependencies using your requirements.txt.

Sometimes if the problem persists you may have to repeat this process and install the dependencies one by one.

Sometimes check your version of python. Try python 3.6.6 if the problem still occurs. Then repeat the above steps.
